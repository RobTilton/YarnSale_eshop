===========================
Your E-Commerce Website
===========================

Overview
========
My Django project is a simple e-commerce website designed to showcase my skills
and understanding in various technologies, including Django, Python, CSS, HTML,
and Django REST Framework. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate 
my capabilities in account creation, database design, API calls, and effective
use of version control systems like Git. 

I've employed Faker to create a script that populates the database with fake 
product data, simulating a real-world application and demonstrating the 
database's functionality. This project serves as a practical example of my 
work for potential employers and fellow developers, highlighting the challenges
I faced and the solutions I implemented. It's a testament to my learning journey 
and a platform where I've applied my theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.
